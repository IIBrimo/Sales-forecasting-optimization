# Sales Forecasting Optimization

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for optimizing sales forecasting using advanced machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide accurate sales forecasts to help businesses make informed decisions.

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks with the data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- `data/`: Directory for storing the datasets used in the project.
- `models/`: Directory for saving trained models.
- `results/`: Directory for storing the results of model evaluations and predictions.

## Installation
To run the notebooks and code in this repository, you need to have Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IIBrimo/Sales-forecasting-optimization.git
    cd Sales-forecasting-optimization
    ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the Jupyter Notebooks to explore the data, preprocess it, train models, and evaluate their performance.

## Notebooks
- `01_data_exploration.ipynb`: Explore the dataset and perform initial data analysis.
- `02_data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Preprocess the data, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering.
- `03_model_training.ipynb`: Train various machine learning models and tune hyperparameters.
- `04_model_evaluation.ipynb`: Evaluate the performance of the trained models and compare results.
- `05_forecasting.ipynb`: Use the best-performing model to make sales forecasts.

## Datasets
The datasets used in this project are stored in the `data/` directory. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access and use these datasets.
